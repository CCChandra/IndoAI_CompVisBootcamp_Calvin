# IndoAI_CompVisBootcamp_Calvin
This is a repository store projects completed in the Indonesia AI Computer Vision bootcamp.
below are subheadings that provides the names of the project along with a brief description of the project.

## Project 1 : Gender Classification
this project encourages us to use and compare 3 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to make predictions on whether an image of a human face is a male or female subject. the 3 CNNs are Visual Group Geometry (VGG), Residual Network (ResNet), and GoogLeNet (or otherwise known as Inception).

## Project 2 : Person Tracking
this project requires us to use an object detection algorithm to detect people in an image or video frame. During our attempt, the only successfully implemented model was the YOLO model.
